--- Produce ---

1) Producer registers employee schema with the schema registry to get a schema
   version ID, this either creates a new ID or reuses the existing one for that
   exact schema

2) Avro serializes the Employee object using the schema

3) Spring Cloud puts the schema-id in the message headers

4) The message is published on the topic

--- Consume ---

5) When the message comes to the consumer, it reads the schema-id from the header

6) Consumer uses schema-id to get the Employee schema from the registry

7) Consumer finds a local class that could represent that object and deserializes
   the message into it
